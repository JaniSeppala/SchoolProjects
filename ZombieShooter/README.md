## Zombie Shooter

Zombie Shooter is a 3D zombie horde game I made for the Game Development Technologies course. I used Cinemachine to control the camera and I also made all the 3D models in the game by myself in Blender, except for the trees that I made using the Unitys built-in generator. The texturing of the 3D models was done in GIMP and all the animations were made in Unity.

## Main features:
- Shoot zombies, collect ammo and try to survive for as long as you can
- Switch between two weapons: A shotgun and a pistol
- Switch between first and third person cameras
- Use the Konami Code in the main menu to play Tetris!
