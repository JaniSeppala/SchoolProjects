Console Tetris is the very first "real" program I have ever made. I made it for the C# programming course in 2018. It is a classic Tetris game that is fully playable in the Windows command-line window.

You can download the game from here: [Click me!](http://homes.jamk.fi/~m3063/pages/stuff/files/cltetris.exe)
