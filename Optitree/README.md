# Optiree Learning Environment

Optitree is a simple online learning environment that I made for the Web Application Development course. It has Angular frontend, Express backend and it uses an SQL database for storing data.

## Main features:
- Create, Inspect, Update and Delete Users
- Create, Inspect, Update and Delete Workspaces
- Create, Inspect, Update and Delete Pages inside the workspaces
- Add and remove students in workspaces
- Three different user roles: Student, Teacher, Admin
- Backend route authentication with JSON Web Token
